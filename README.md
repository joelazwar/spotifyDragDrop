## Setting Up `appsettings.json`

The application requires an `appsettings.json` file in the root directory to function correctly. This file contains critical configuration values such as API keys for YouTube and Spotify.

### Steps to Set Up:
1. **Locate the Template**:
   - A template file named `appsettings.template.json` is included in the repository.
   - Copy this file and rename it to `appsettings.json`.

2. **Edit the File**:
   - Open `appsettings.json` and replace the placeholder values (`<YOUR_API_KEY>`, `<YOUR_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID>`, etc.) with your actual credentials.
